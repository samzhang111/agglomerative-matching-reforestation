# Land tenure regimes influenced long-term restoration successes and reversals across Brazil’s Atlantic Forest 

This is the code for our agglomerative matching technique, and for reproducing the results in the paper "Land tenure regimes influenced long-term restoration successes and reversals across Brazil’s Atlantic Forest", by Rayna Benzeev, Sam Zhang, Pedro Piffer, and Meg Mills-Novoa.

This repository is organized according to [Principled Data Processing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSunU9GQdcI).

The tasks are:
1. `import`
2. `construct_superlands`
3. `matching`
4. `summarize`
5. `visualize`

## Setup

Run `make scaffold`, and place `all_lands.shp` in `import/input`. Furthermore, install all of the packages in `requirements.txt`, as is typical in Python projects.
